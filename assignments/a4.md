![Start early to avoid last-minute issues!]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a4/gpt2_no_procrastination_smaller.png)
<!--p style="font-size:23px;"><strong>Start Early to Avoid Last-Minute Issues!!</strong></p--> 

## FAQs

* **Heads-up1:** Pretrain/fine-tune using a single CPU core can be time-consuming 
(a single run may be taking 40 minutes to 2 hours). So start early.
* **Heads-up2:** **WORK-IN-PROGRESS VERSION. DO NOT START WORKING ON IT BEFORE A4'S OFFICIALLY RELEASED!**
* For this assignment, recommended EC2 instance type is **m5.large** with a  volume size is **100GB**.


## Overview

This assignment is for you to gain hands-on experience in LLM
training/fine-tuning on AWS EC2.  You will just need a single
EC2 instance with a 100GB SSD volume. You will then
develop two training applications using HuggingFace's [Transformers
library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index):

* a "pretrain" program,
* and a "fine-tune" program,

to train/fine-tune a small, 124M-parameter
[GPT2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.5.1/model_doc/gpt2.html#overview)
model. 

You will also deploy your fine-tuned model using a
[Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) server and chat with your own
custom GPT2 from a local computer, or anywhere on the Internet.
You will also prepare a short report detailing your observations,
 experience, with links to a few demo videos that you will make at the end
of this assignment.

This will be even more fun! 😎


## Learning outcomes

The learning outcomes of this assignment are to:

* Write simple training applications using the Transformers library.
* Fine-tune a small language model with different fine-tuning datasets.
* Deploy a Docker container for model serving and inference.
* Deploy a minimal ChatGPT-like client to enable client-server communication.


## Part 0: Environment setup

Like the previous assignments you will complete this assignment on
AWS. Hopefully by now you have got yourself familiar with setting
things up in AWS via Academy.
See [Assignment 0](/ds5110-spring25/assignments/a0) about how 
to use AWS Academy to access AWS cloud resources. 
See [Assignment 1](/ds5110-spring25/assignments/a1) about how
to change network settings to enable ALL TCP traffic.
  
In this assignment, you only need to create **one** EC2 VM instances
of type `m5.large`. 
(You can use `t3.large` for this assignment; it's just that
`m5.large` provides a lightly better and more steady computing power
than `t3.large`.) 
(Create five EC2 instances of the same
You can name it with `llm` or anything you like.

I don't recommend reusing your existing EC2 instances from A3, as those
instances come with smaller, 50GB GP2 SSD storage. 
Fine-tuning is both **storage-intensive** and **compute-intensive**,
so it's best to configure your VM using a 100GB GP2 SSD volume to ensure
you have enough storage space. 


### Change network settings by adding a new ALL TCP security group

> You need to configure the **Network settings** of all
EC2 instances. You can reuse the existing security group that you created
for A3. 

![Add Security Group in Network Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a1/add_security_group_TCP.png)


For a new EC2 instance, always run `apt update` before installing any
dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
```

Install the following Python dependencies including Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
$ pip3 install notebook
$ pip3 install torch numpy transformers datasets tiktoken wandb tqdm 'accelerate>=0.26.0' ipywidgets
$ source .profile
```

You also need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/):

```bash
$ sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
$ sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
$ sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
$ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
$ echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt update
```

Next, install the Docker packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

To verify that the Docker installation is successful, run:

```bash
$ sudo docker --version
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

Finally, download all code skeleton files and shell scripts at 
[this link](/ds5110-spring25/assets/datasets/a4.zip) for Part 1-3. 


## Part 1: Pretrain a GPT2


Your job in this part is to implement a training process to
"pretrain" a GPT2 with a very basic training dataset provided in the
code skeleton file `a4_part1_gpt2_pretrain_skeleton.ipynb`.

**Task 1:** Your first task for this part is to write code for 
training setup and initialization.

**Task 2:** Your second task is to update the learning rate manually
for each `param_group` in `optimizer.param_groups`. 

**Task 3:** Your third task is to evaluate the model, record the best
validation loss, and save a checkpoint file at `eval_interval`. 

**Task 4:** Your fourth task is to perform forward and backward pass,
calculate the average loss value, and prefetch next batch of training
sample.

**Task 5:** Your last task is to run the optimization process. 


Each training iteration runs for 1-1.4 seconds on average. So running
2000 iterations will require around 30-40 minutes to complete. You
could change the `max_iters` to shorten or extend the training. With
1500-2000 iterations, the model should be able to answer basic
question about GPT based on your predefined training dataset. 

**Document** the training time and prompt test results in your report.
See [Deliverables](/ds5110-spring25/assignments/a4#deliverables) for the requirement of a report. 


## Part 2: Fine-tune a GPT2 using a Q&A dataset


Your job for Part 2 is to implement a training process in
`a4_part2_finetune_skeleton.ipynb` to "fine-tune" a base GPT2 with a
dataset called
[`alpaca-1k`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dolo650/alpaca_1k).
This dataset contains 1000 Q&A entries. The base GPT2 is not able
to handle almost all of these Q&As at all. Our goal for Part 2 is to
train a fine-tuned GPT2 so that it has some limited ability to
handle basic or paraphrased questions similar to those in
`alpaca-1k`. In reality, you'll find, even after a few hours'
fine-tuning, your custom GPT2 may still struggle with many questions,
 but it should perform much better than the base GPT2. If you observe such
improvement, you've successfully achieved the goal for Part 2.

You don't have to download the dataset as the Transformers library
will download it automatically for you. 


There are three tasks for Part 2:

**Task 1:** In this task you will just fill the training cell by adding
the following code:

* Step 1: Set the seed for reproducibility
* Step 2: Load model and tokenizer using the Transformer library API
* Step 3: Prepare the dataset (`dolo650/alpaca-1k`)
* Step 4: Set up trainer 
* Step 5: Start the fine-tuning process

Your default fine-tuning process will run for 100 steps (set via `max_steps`).
With 1000 Q&A entries, it will take around 1 hour and  a half to 2 hours to 
complete 100 steps. 

A commodity GPU would train much faster than this 🚀. Try it on a free
NVIDIA T4 GPU in a Colab notebook and see how much speedup you
achieve, though using Colab GPU is not required for this assignment. 

**Task 2:** Your second task is to reduce the training dataset by explicitly
limiting the fine-tuning range to the first `N` Q&A entries. This can be 
set in `prepare_dataset()`. 
This task is divided into two subtasks:

* Task 2.1: Configure `N` in `prepare_dataset()`
* Task 2.2: Modify `output_dir` in the configurations cell so that
your next fine-tuning will not overwrite the existing fine-tuned
model from previous runs.

**Document** the training time and the testing result by varying `N` in
your report.

**Task 3:** Your third task is to implement a prompt testing program to 
prompt the fine-tuned model. You will need to add code to `a4_part2_test_finetuned_skeleton.ipynb`:

* Task 3.1: Load a model and a tokenizer
* Task 3.2: Write a test prompt that paraphrases a sample in your fine-tuning dataset and tokenize the input
* Task 3.3: Generate output tokens and decode it

**Report** the training times and prompt test results in your report.
See [Deliverables](/ds5110-spring25/assignments/a4#deliverables) for the requirement of a report. 


## Part 3: Fine-tune a GPT2 using your own dataset


The most **fun** part: you will fine-tune a base GPT2 model using a
dataset of your choice. You can pick any dataset you like. There is
only one requirement:

The dataset you choose should not be too big. In case you use a large
dataset, you need to write code to explicitly select a subset of
samples to keep the fine-tuning time reasonable.

> **NOTE:** Part 3 is open-ended, so you can do any types of
customization in any part of your code.

**Duplicate** your `.ipynb` file from Part 2 and name it
`a4_part3_finetune_<dataset_name>.ipynb`.

Part 3 includes three *required* tasks and one *optional* task (for extra credit 🌟):

**Task 1:** Customize the `tokenize_function`
in `prepare_dataset()`, as different datasets have different formats.

**Task 2:** Run the fine-tuning process and **document** your training time
and prompt test results in the report. 


**Task 3:** In this task, you will launch a containerized text generation inference 
server that hosts your fine-tuned model and interact with it through a Chatbot web interface.

Containerize a [Python
server](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) for
text generation inference. The Docker container is from 
`ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference`. A shell
script named `launch_gpt2.sh` is provided to help you provision and launch a `text-generation-inference`
Docker container on your EC2 VM instance. 
You will need to change line 3 of the script with the path to your
own model directory:

```bash
model_path=$PWD/<YOUR_FINE_TUNED_MODEL_DIR>  # Path to your model directory
```


Before running the Docker container, you need to grant execution permission
to `launch_gpt2.sh`:

```bash
$ chmod +x launch_gpt2.sh
```

To deploy and run the Docker container:

```bash
$ ./launch_gpt2.sh
```

If this is the first time you run the script, it will first download
the Docker container from DockerHub and then start the server--it takes several
minutes to fully download the container image. You will see a Docker
pull log while it's downloading the container:

```bash
ubuntu@ip-170-30-11-11:~/a4$ ./launch_gpt2.sh
Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.1.0' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.1.0
```

After the container is downloaded, it takes about a minute to fully
start the server. Wait until you see a `Connected` message shown as
the following:

```bash
2025-03-28T02:16:12.905714Z  INFO text_generation_router::server: router/src/server.rs:2423: Connected
```

Verify that the text generation inference server container image has
been downloaded by running:

```bash
ubuntu@ip-170-30-11-11:~/a4$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY                                      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference   3.1.0     6724f1647f1b   8 weeks ago   12.2GB
```

A `prompt.sh` script is provided for communication with the server.
Again, make sure to give it execution permission by running `chmod +x prompt.sh`.

To run the script:

```bash
$ ./prompt.sh "<YOUR_PROMPT_TEXT>" <MAX_OUTPUT_TOKEN_LEN>
```

Replace `<YOUR_PROMPT_TEXT>` and `<MAX_OUTPUT_TOKEN_LEN>` with your prompt test. 
An example script command looks like the following:

```bash
$ ./prompt.sh "Provide a list of three random colors." 100
```

If you can see a returned output that looks like the output tokens
generated by your model, **congratulations** 🎉 -- your ***minimalist***
chatbot service is up and running! 

> **NOTE:** If you run `prompt.sh` from a local computer, you will need
to replace the `localhost` with the public IPv4 DNS address of your EC2
instance.

Having a good interface frontend is part of a good data system
design.  Now that you have a Dockerized backend server running, next,
you will deploy a simple frontend for your own model.

To do so, download the HTML file at [this link](/ds5110-spring25/assets/datasets/index.html) 
to a local computer (**NOT** your EC2 instance). This HTML 
is your minimal ChatGPT-style client (a minimalist version), which
connects to your Dockerized fine-tuned model running on your EC2. 

> **NOTE:** Replace `<EC2_public_IPv4_DNS_address>` in line 81 with
your actual EC2 IPv4 DNS address. 

Open it in a browser, you can now chat with your Dockerized chatbot.

![chatbot web interface2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a4/chatbot_web_interface2.jpeg)

**What you need to do for Task 3:**

***Record a short video demo*** that captures the following process:
1. Launching your Dockerized backend model server on EC2, 
2. Opening your minimal ChatGPT-style client webpage in your browser,
3. Having a few rounds of conversation with your chatbot.


**Task 4 (extra credit 🌟):** 
This optional task encourages you to do something interesting!
In this task, you will do some [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)
to design / create / renovate a better client interface. This interface
could be a complete redesign based on the HTML that I provided, or an enhancement
with additional functionality--such as configuring the output token
sequence length, temperature or uploading a JSON file as a prompt.
You're also welcome to use more advanced frontend tools like 
[React](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

***Again, record a short video demo*** that captures the following process:
1. Launching your Dockerized backend model server on EC2, 
2. Opening your advanced client webpage in your browser,
3. Having a few rounds of interactions with your chatbot.

the assignment, the GTA will be looking at your code as well as the
comments (comments serve as a `README` for a particular task).  

For the **PDF report**, in addition to the training time and prompt testing
results for Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3, 
you should also include **the link to a viewable video recording**
(you can use Zoom to make the video) for Part 3 (and optionally, a
separate link to a video recording for Part 3 Task 4). 
**DO NOT include any video files to your submitted `tar.gz` file.**
