# Using AWS Academy, EC2, and Linux Shell

## FAQs

* If you have trouble signing up AWS Academy due to the term item not
showing up, it's because of the browser compatibility issue. Try
updating your Firefox and then try logging in using Firefox. (I will
contact the AWS Academy support to see how this can be addressed as
this is obviously a bug!)
* If you work with WSL, make sure to store your SSH key file under your
Ubuntu home directory. Windows FS does not work well with `chmod
400`. How to locate your `/home/user` directory is by 
typing `cd` and that will automatically bring you to your home dir. 
* Accessing the SSH key file stored under a cloud drive (OneDrive,
Dropbox, or Google Drive) might have permission issue. If that
happens, move `vockey.pem` to a local directory not under any
cloud-managed folder and that should fix the permission issue. 
* For Windows user, we recommend installing WSL (the Windows Subsystem for Linux).
You can find the installation documentation
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). With
WSL, you can use the familiar Linux commands for SSH, file
operations, and all other kinds of
[shell-related](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php) tasks. 
* To copy your submission file from remote EC2 to local, you can use 
`scp` (SSH copy). To do so:
```sh
scp -i vockey.pem ubuntu@YOUR_ADDRESS:PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE .
```
Note that calling scp from EC2 to copy file out will not work as your computer
is behind NAT so it is almost not possible to be directly addressable. You need to run scp from your computer to copy file in from a remote EC2, which is addressable. 



## Overview

You will do all your assignments for DS5110 using [AWS
Academy](https://www.awsacademy.com/vforcesite/LMS_Login).
Through AWS Academy, you can get access to a wide range of computing,
storage, and network resources on [Amazon Web
Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS). If you haven't worked with
AWS Academy before, you need to go through the AWS Academcy
onboarding process. 

This assignment will walk you through the AWS Academy registration
process and show you how to use AWS and Linux EC2 from AWS Academy to
setup an environment for upcoming programming assignments. 



## Learning outcomes

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Create and SSH into an EC2 virtual machine (EC2) instance.
* Create a remote Jupyter Notebook server running on AWS EC2.
* Get familiar with basic Linux shell commands (browsing file system, installing packages, etc.).



## Part 0: Register an AWS Academy account

You will receive a course invitation email sent to your `virginia.edu` email. 
You will need to register with AWS Academy Canvas (note this is different from UVA Canvas) before you can participate in the AWS Academy Learner Lab. 
To register, click on `Get Started` in the invitation email. It will bring you to the `Welcome Aboard` web page. Enter a password under your email, select `Eastern Time (US & Canada)` as the Time Zone, and click on `Register`. 

After successfully registered, you will have access to your AWS Academy portal. You will see the AWS Academy Learner Lab under `Dashboard`. Click on `Accept` to accept the invitation to join AWS Academy Learner Lab if you see a message at the very top of the web page. 

Click on AWS Academy Learner Lab at the Dashboard to enter. Then
click on `Modules` to view the available modules. 
Before start using AWS resources, I highly encourage you to go through the 
`AWS Academy Learner Lab Student Guide` to get you familiar with how to use
Learner Lab (including how to start a lab, how to track your credit, etc.). 

To start using the AWS resources, click on `Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab` under
`Module`, which will bring you to the Terms and Conditions. Click on
`I agree` and enter the lab session. 

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_guide_launch_lab.jpg)

The lab session is a web terminal interface with limited
functionality. To start the lab, click on `Start Lab` at the top of
the web terminal interface. The starting process should take a few
minutes (if this is the very first time you start the lab, as in the
background AWS Academy creates a temporary AWS account for you under
the Learner Lab). At the same time, you can see your available AWS
cloud credit with a total amount of $50 and how much you have used.
When the signal light at the top left corner turns green, it
indicates the lab has started. 

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_dash1.png)

Click on the green signal light to access your AWS Console Home web
page. 

A started lab session has a session duration of up to 
four hours (see the timer `04:00` in the figure above). When the lab
session timer runs to `0:00`, the session will automatically end, but
any data and resources that you created in the AWS account will be
retained. If you later launch a new session (for example, the next
day), you will find that your work is still in the lab environment.
Running EC2 instances will be stopped and then automatically
restarted the next time you start a session. 

> **IMPORTANT:** Monitor your lab budget in the lab interface above. 
Whenever you have an active lab session, the latest known remaining
budget information will display at the top of this screen. This data
comes from AWS Budgets which typically updates every 8 to 12 hours.
Therefore the remaining budget that you see may not reflect your most
recent account activity.  **If you exceed your lab budget your lab
account will be disabled and all progress and resources will be lost.**
As a best practice, we **highly recommend** frequently pushing your
progress to online repositories such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)
to avoid losing data. Therefore, it is important for you to manage
your spending. When you use GitHub or any other online repository service,
make sure to create a **private** repository; **DO NOT** share any of 
your code to other students and the internet.

At the AWS Console Home page, click on `Services` at the top left
corner and click on `Compute` to view all the available computing
services that you may use. Click on `EC2` to start creating new EC2
VM (virtual machine) instances. 


## Part 1: Create and access EC2 instances

### Step 1: Create a name and choose an OS image for your VM
Under `EC2`, click on `Launch instances` to start creating a new VM.
Type a name to label your VM under `Name and tags`. For example, name
your first instance `vm0`.

We recommend using Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as the OS image and
`64-bit (x86)` as the architecture. You can also specify the number of
instances to launch at this time. To start off, choose 1. Later for
[Assignment 1](/ds5110-spring23/assignments/a1) choose 2 and for
[Assignment 2](/ds5110-spring23/assignments/a2) choose 5.

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm0.png)

### Step 2: Choose an EC2 instance type
Next choose an EC2 instance type.  To test, you can always create one
or multiple `t2.micro` or `t1.micro`, both of which are free tier
eligible, meaning the resource is free of charge. 
There are, however, a limited range of EC2 instances that you can
choose from. We recommend using the `t3.large` instance type that comes
with 2 vCPU cores and 8 GB of memory.

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm1.png)

### Step 3: Choose an SSH key pair
What is important when creating new VMs is that you choose a key pair
for SSH login. Under `Key pair (login)`, click on the drop down menu
and select `vockey (type rsa)`. 

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm2.png)

### Step 4: Check HTTP/HTTPS options
Under `Network settings`, you may check `Allow HTTPs traffic from the
internet` and `Allow HTTP traffic from the internet` so that you can
access the web servers hosted on your EC2 VM. (Apache Spark comes
with a web-based dash, and would require HTTP/HTTPS traffic.) 

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm3.png)

### Step 5: Configure storage
You may also increase the storage capacity of the `Root volume` under
`Configure storage`. By default you will be allocated a small 8-GB
root disk. We recommend increasing it to 100 GB so that you have
sufficient disk storage capacity for dependency installation and
storing datasets. Optionally, you can also add a new EBS volume of
100GB just in case the 100GB root volume runs out of capacity (it
runs out of space very fast considering the installation of quite a
few large software packages and datasets).

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm4.png)

### Step 6: Configure the subnet availability zone
We recommend launching all your EC2 instances in the same
availability zone. Any US east zones should be fine. This can be
configured in Network settings. Once choosing one, always stick with
it when creating new EC2 instances. This is to guarantee the best
network performance among your EC2 instances.
For example, you may choose to use a subnet within an availability
zone of `us-east-1a` and stick with it.

![EC2 instances]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm5.png)

### Step 7: Launch the EC2 instance
After finalizing the EC2 VM configuration, click on the `Launch
instance` button on the right side to launch the configured VM. It
may take a few minutes to start the VM. 

### Step 8: Download the SSH private key
Now go back to the Learner Lab web page. This is where you can
download the SSH key. Click on the `AWS Details` tab, you will see
the information you need to login to your computing resources. Under
`SSH key`, click on `Download PEM` to download the SSH key to your
local computer. It comes with a default name of `labsuser.pem`.

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/aws_academy_ssh_key.png)

### Step 9: Login to the EC2 instance through SSH
Open a terminal (if you use a MacBook, open the `Terminal` software;
if you use a Windows, we recommend [installing WSL](#01242023)),
locate your private key file that you have just downloaded locally,
change its name to `vockey.pem` and update its permission, if
necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable:

```bash
% mv labsuser.pem vockey.pem
% chmod 400 vockey.pem
```

Then, connect to your instance using the following command:

```bash
% ssh -i "vockey.pem" ubuntu@[public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance]
``` 

To view the connection instruction, click on the instance ID from
your AWS Console, then click on `Connect` at the top right corner of
the page to view the public DNS address of your EC2 instance. An
example name looks something like this:
`ubuntu@ec2-11-222-3-190.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, where `ubuntu` is
your default username on any EC2 instances that you created. 

![AWS Academy Setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a0/ec2_create_vm6.png)


Great! So far you should be able to SSH login to a remote Linux VM computer
that you have just created on AWS running on somewhere in some North Virginia
datacenter! 



## Part 2: Setting Up an AWS-EC2-hosted Jupyter Notebook Service

There are two ways of writing/editing PySpark programs on a remote
cloud server:
* Use a shell text editor of your choice (e.g., VIM, nano, Emacs, etc.).
* Launch a Jupyter Notebook and directly write PySpark code there.

This tutorial is provided in case you need to use
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
for Assignment 1, though you can complete the assignment without it.


### Step 0: Install Pip

First, install `pip3` (the [package installer for Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)).

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-pip
$ which pip3
```

The third command above, `which pip3`, should output something like
`/usr/bin/pip3` if it's successfully installed.


### Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
$ pip3 install notebook
```

`pip3` by default will install everything in `/home/ubuntu/.local/bin` on
your EC2 instance. This path, however, is not included by the
environment variable `$PATH`, so your shell will not be able to
locate the installed programs through `pip3`. To fix this, you will
need to include the path in `$PATH` by running the following command:

```sh
$ source ~/.profile
$ which jupyter
```


### Step 2: Deploy a Jupyter Notebook server

SSH into your EC2 instance where you've just installed the Jupyter
Notebook (say the scheduler instance `vm1`) using the following
command:

```sh
$ ssh -i "vockey.pem" ubuntu@<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance> -L 8000:localhost:8888
```

The `-L` option is to forward any connections to the given TCP port
`8000` on your local client host to the given remote
host (the specified EC2 instance of `<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_your_EC2_instance>`)
and port (`8888`), or Unix socket, on the remote side.

Once SSH'ed in, start the Jupyter Notebook server process using command
`jupyter notebook`. You will see some output information generated
by the launched Notebook server process:

```
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
    file:///home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-3233-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=557f06135dd4c77bc5267c88abca55db1672f741ff7631a4
 or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=557f06135dd4c77bc5267c88abca55db1672f741ff7631a4
```

On your local client machine, open a web browser and go to
`localhost:8000` and copy paste the token when it prompts. Now you
can start writing Python code using your Notebook GUI from your
browser.



### Step 3: Work on Python programming using your cloud-native Notebook


Create a new Notebook and select the default `Python 3 (ipykernel)`
Notebook kernel. Than you are good to go.

## Part 3: Shell Script

If you have successfully cleared all previous parts and steps, congratulations! 
Now you have a cloud VM with basic programming environment setup. 

In this part, you will practice some basic shell command / shell script skill
by completing the following tasks.


### Task 1: Check Operating System version, hardware configuration, and your Jupyter Notebook install

Create some system and environment information using basic shell commands. 
You should use `man` the Linux manual command to print what a command does.
For example, if you type `man lscpu` it will tell you what `lscpu` is. 
**Save the outputs to submit**:

```sh
$ cat /etc/os-release > os.txt
$ lscpu > cpu.txt
$ lsmem > mem.txt
```

Then, create some more files so we can check your install of pip3 and
Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
$ pip3 --version > pip3.txt
$ jupyter --version > jupyter.txt
```


### Task 2: 

This zip file contains two CSV files with StackOverflow post data. You need
to download the dataset to your EC2 VM instance:

```sh
pip3 install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vlczaocHyghEW5Q-6WprqB2nnna_wrLE
```

In the above commands, the first command is to install the downloading tool
`gdown` so that you can use it to download large files from Google Drive. 

Try running some shell commands to extract the contents and print how
many lines contain the text `"python"`.

Now, combine these commands in a `count_python.sh` script file; the script
should have a shebang line so that the following runs with bash:

```sh
$ ./count_python.sh
```

> **HINTS:** You can use `unzip` to extract the CSV files from the zip
archive. If `unzip` is not installed by default, you should 
run `sudo apt install -y unzip` to install it on your EC2 instance. 




## Deliverables

You should submit a `tar.gz` file to Canvas, which follows the naming convention
of `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A0.tar.gz`. The submitted file should contain
the following:
`os.txt`, `cpu.txt`, `mem.txt`, `pip3.txt`, `jupyter.txt`, `count_python.sh`. 

> **HINTS:** You can use the following command to create a `tar.gz` file:
`tar -czvf [submission_file_name] os.txt cpu.txt mem.txt pip3.txt jupyter.txt count_python.sh`.



## Autograder

You can use supplied autograding test suite to test your work and environment setup. 
There are two `.py` files you need to download: `autograde.py` (https://tddg.github.io/ds5110-spring25/assets/datasets/autograde.py) and `tester.py` (https://tddg.github.io/ds5110-spring25/assets/datasets/tester.py). 
Use `wget` to download these two files from the links above. 
Run `python3 autograder.py` to test your work. The test result will
be written to a `test.json` file in your working directory. This will
probably be your grade, but autograders are imperfect, so we reserve
the right to deduct further points. Some cases are when students
acheive the correct output by hardcoding, or not using an approach we
specifically requested.
