# A tour of Apache HDFS and Spark


## FAQs

* **PLEASE DO NOT PROCRASTINATE!!** If you wait till the last minute to work on 
your assignment and ask for help, no one will be able to help you.
These assignments are not hard, but some steps might take longer than
you expect, esp. when you are new to it. So, start working on it
**EARLY**.
* For A2, if your decide to create new VMs, you need to follow the same 
practice as you did for A1 and explicitly add a new security group by
allowing all TCP traffic. This is to ensure that your HDFS workers
and Spark workers are able to communicate across the network using
TCP.
* You can download the skeleton code [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/72907/discussion/6193978).
* Watch the HDFS setup video [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/72907/discussion/6203677).



## Overview

This assignment is designed to support your in-class understanding of
how big data analytics stacks work and get some hands-on experience
in using them. You will need to deploy Apache Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS) as the underlying file system and Apache Spark as the
execution engine. You will then develop several small applications
based on them. You will produce a short report detailing your
observations and takeaways.



## Learning outcomes

The objectives of this assignment are to:

* Configure and deploy Apache HDFS and Apache Spark using remote SSH and Linux terminal.
* Write simple Spark applications and launch them in a cluster.
* Describe how Apache HDFS and Apache Spark work, and interact with each other.



## Part 0: Environment setup

You will complete this assignment in AWS Academy.  
In this assignment, you should create two EC2 VM instances of type
`t3.large`. (Create two EC2 instances of the same type
and then rename them: hover over the instance name and click on the
edit button to change name; with a meaningful name like `vm1` and
`vm2` you can easily know which instance you are logging into.) You
will then deploy a two-node HDFS cluster and a two-node Spark cluster
on these two EC2 instances. 

Both Hadoop HDFS and Spark use Java. So, as the first step, you
should run the following commands on every EC2 instance to install
Java. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS comes with `python3` (`Python 3.10.6`)
installed. So you don't need to manually install python yourself.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
```

> **NOTE:** You can skip this step if you reuse your Dask cluster from A1 (as
the password-free SSH is already configured).

Then, you should enable password-free SSH service between the two EC2
instances. To do so, you need to generate a private/public key pair using:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

on the leader EC2 instance node (which we call `vm1`). The other EC2 instance
will be assigned as follower. Then, manually copy the public key of `vm1` to the
`authorized_key` file in **both** of the two instances (`vm1` **and** `vm2`) under 
`~/.ssh/`. To get the content of the public key saved in `id_rsa.pub`, do:

```sh
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then copy the entire output of the above command to `authorized_key`.
Make sure you do not append any newlines.
Otherwise it will not work.
**Also note that you should NOT overwrite the existing line in
`authorized_key` file. Otherwise you will no longer be able to login
to your VM.**   

Once you are done with `vm1`, you should copy the content of
`id_rsa.pub` in `vm1` over to `~/.ssh/authorized_key` in `vm2`. This
way, the leader node `vm1` will have password-free SSH access to both
itself and its follower node `vm2`. 

> **IMPORTANT:** This is a critical step: if you do not complete this step, the
startup script will not be able to remote start the HDFS/Spark daemon
process on `vm2` (you will get permission denied error).



## Part 1: Software deployment

![HDFS and Spark cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/a2/hdfs_spark.png)

### Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

[Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is a collection of
open-source software utilities that provide simple MapReduce parallel
programming models for batch processing of large datasets. It mainly
consists of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop
MapReduce, and Hadoop YARN. In this assignment, we will only use
HDFS. HDFS consists of a NameNode process running on the leader
instance and a set of DataNode processes running on follower
instances. The NameNode records file-system-level metadata and
handles file data retrieval and storage requests. The DataNode
processes store actual data. 

Figure(a) above depicts a logical architecture of how Spark interacts
with HDFS.

You can find the detailed deployment instructions in this [link](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) or you
can follow our simplified version:


### Step 1: Download the software

Let's first download Hadoop on each of the two EC2 VM instances. Note
that you can do this on `vm1` and then `scp` (ssh-copy) to copy the
downloaded software tar ball to `vm2`.

```sh
$ cd ~
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
$ tar zvxf hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz
$ cd hadoop-3.3.6
```

### Step 2: Modify configuration files

There are a few configuration files that we need to edit. For HDFS, you can 
make edits on `vm1` and then copy the files to `vm2`. These configuration files
are originally empty (with comments) so users need to manually set them. Add
the following content to replace  the empty `<configuration> ... </configuration>` field
in `hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml`:


```
<configuration>
<property>
<name>fs.default.name</name>
<value>hdfs://namenode_IP:9000</value>
</property>
</configuration>
```

where `namenode_IP` refers to the **private** IP address of the EC2 instance. 

> **NOTE:** You can use either the private IPv4 IP address or the
public IPv4 DNS address.  We recommend using the private IPv4 IP
address as that will allow the data to go through private subnet. The
`namenode_IP` can be found from the AWS Console: at AWS Console,
click the corresponding EC2 instance, and copy the private IPv4
address from the instance summary.

Next, edit the file system directories in `hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml`.
Make sure you create the folders and specify the correct paths. For example, create
`hadoop-3.3.6/data/namenode/` and `hadoop-3.3.6/data/datanode` and
set each to be the path for the value of the `dfs.namenode.name.dir`
field and `dfs.datanode.data.dir` field, respectively (see the template
`hdfs-site.xml` configuration file listed below). 
The third configuration property indicates the size of the HDFS block,
which in the example is set to 64MB. (By default HDFS is configured with
a block size of 128MB.)
These directories indicate where data
for the NameNode and DataNode will be stored respectively. **Note**
that the path in the xml file should be absolute; also **note** that
the same path needs to be manually created by yourself on both the
leader instance `vm1` and the follower instance `vm2`, because HDFS
will run a DataNode process on each machine of the cluster. 


```
<configuration>
<property>
<name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
<value>/path/to/namenode/dir/</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
<value>/path/to/datanode/dir</value>
</property>
<property>
<name>dfs.block.size</name>
<value>67108864</value>
<description>Block size</description>
</property>
</configuration>
```

You also need to manually specify `JAVA_HOME` in `hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh`
so that HDFS can be launched. You can get the path with the following command:

```sh
$ update-alternatives --display java
```

Take the value of the current link and remove the trailing
`/bin/java`. For example, a possible link can be
`/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre`. Then, uncomment line 54 in
`hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh` and
set the `JAVA_HOME` by
replacing `export JAVA_HOME=` with `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre`.

You also need to edit `hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/workers` to add the IP
address of all the datanodes. Once again use the private IPv4
address. In our case for this assignment, you need to add two lines,
each containing the IPv4 address of an EC2 instance corresponding to
a datanode process. This way, the deployed HDFS can store data on
both `vm1` and `vm2`.  (Delete the existing `localhost` line in this
file.) 


### Step 3: Copy modified config files to the other EC2 instance

Then, copy the config files with these changes to `vm2` as well. For example:

```sh
$ scp hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/workers hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh ubuntu@<IP_of_vm2>:~/hadoop-3.3.6/etc/hadoop/
```

Where `ubuntu` is the user name on `vm2` and `<IP_of_vm2>` is the IP address of `vm2`.


### Step 4: Add Hadoop binary paths to $PATH and start the HDFS

Now, from within `vm1`, add the absolute paths to `hadoop-3.3.6/bin`
and `hadoop-3.3.6/sbin` to `$PATH`.  To do so, `echo` the `export`
line to the end of `~/.bashrc` file and source it to make the changes
effective:

```sh
$ echo 'export PATH="/home/ubuntu/hadoop-3.3.6/bin:/home/ubuntu/hadoop-3.3.6/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

After this operation, you should be able to directly address all the
binary executables of Hadoop that you have just installed. 

Next, format the NameNode and start the NameNode and DataNode daemon processes
on your cluster:

```sh
$ hdfs namenode -format
$ start-dfs.sh
```

This will format the HDFS data paths that you have just configured in Step 2
and start all the deamons.

To check the HDSF status over the HDFS dashboard, go to the following
URL on your browser:

```
<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_vm1>:9870/dfshealth.html
```

Where `public_IPv4_DNS_address` can be found in your AWS Console. 

You can also use command `jps` to check whether HDFS is up and
running. There should be a `NameNode` process that is running on
`vm1`, and a `DataNode` process running on each of your two EC2
instnaces. 

Now that your distributed HDFS cluster is all set, type the following 
to see the available commands that you can use to manage HDFS. 

```sh
$ hdfs dfs -help
```

To stop the HDFS cluster, type:

```sh
$ stop-dfs.sh
```


### Apache Spark

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) is a 
powerful open-source analytics engine for big data processing.
Spark is built on its core idea of [Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi12/nsdi12-final138.pdf). Spark standalone
consists of a set of daemons: a `Master` daemon, and a set of
`Worker` daemons. Spark applications are coordinated by a
`SparkContext` object, which will connect to the `Master`, which is
responsible for allocating resources across applications. Once
connected, Spark acquires `Executors` on every `Worker` node in the
cluster, which are processes that run computations and store data for
your applications. Finally, the application's tasks are handed to
`Executors` for execution. We will use Spark in standalone mode,
which means that it does not need to rely on resource management
systems like YARN.

Figure(b) above depicts a physical architecture of the HDFS and Spark
deployment.

Instructions on deploying a Spark cluster can be found in 
Spark's [official document](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).
Or you can follow our minimalist instructions as follows.

### Step 1: Download the software

First, download and decompress the Spark tar ball on each EC2 instance
in the cluster:

```sh
$ wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.3.1/spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz
$ tar zvxf spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3.tgz
```


### Step 2: Modify configuration files

The downloaded Spark 3.3 provide template configuration files with a
common suffix of `.template` in  `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/spark-env.sh`; 
just remove the suffix and make direct edits in them.

Spark 3.3 requires Python 3.7 or higher. AWS' Ubuntu 22.04 LTS comes
with `python3` (`Python 3.10.6`), and therefore, this dependency is already
satisfied. 
Add the following lines to `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/spark-env.sh` on both
`vm1` and `vm2`:

```sh
export PYSPARK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
```

Similar to HDFS, on `vm1` you will need to modify `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/workers`
 to include the private IP addresses of all the worker machines
(including both `vm1` and `vm2`). 

Next, bind Spark to the private IP address by setting the `SPARK_LOCAL_IP`
and `SPARK_MASTER_HOST` in `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/spark-env.sh`. 
According to the comments in `spark-env.sh`, `SPARK_LOCAL_IP` will be set with
the IP address Spark binds to on this node, and `SPARK_MASTER_HOST` will be set
with the IP address of the master instance. You only need to do this on `vm1`.
To do so, add the following lines to `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/spark-env.sh`:

```sh
export SPARK_LOCAL_IP=<private_IPv4_address_of_vm1>
export SPARK_MASTER_HOST=<private_IPv4_address_of_vm1>
```


### Step 3: Start the Spark cluster

To start the Spark standalone cluster, run the following command on `vm1`:

```sh
$ spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/sbin/start-all.sh
```

Go to `<public_IPv4_DNS_address_of_vm1>:8080` (Spark web dashboard) on your browser to
check the status of the Spark cluster.

To check if the cluster is up and running, you can use `jps` to check that 
a `Master` process is running on `vm1` and a `Worker` process is running 
on each of your EC2 instances.

To stop the Spark cluster, run:

```sh
$ spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/sbin/stop-all.sh
```

Next, setup the properties for the memory and CPU used by Spark
applications. Set Spark driver memory to 4GB and executor memory to
4GB. Note that the `t3.large` EC2 instance has only 8GB of memory
and 2 vCPU cores.
Set executor cores to be 2 and number of cpus per task to be 1.
Document about setting properties is [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.0/configuration.html#spark-properties). One example configuration in `spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3/conf/spark-defaults.conf` is shown as follows:

```
spark.master                   spark://<private_IPv4_address_of_vm1>:7077
spark.driver.memory            4g
spark.executor.memory          4g
spark.executor.cores           2
spark.task.cpus                1
```

Enter the following URL to your browser to view the Spark Jobs dashboard:
`public_IPv4_DNS_address_vm1:4040`.
Note that you don't need SSH port forwarding to do so.


## Part 2: A simple Spark application

In this part, you will implement a simple Spark application. We have
provided some sample data collected at 
[this link](https://tddg.github.io/ds5110-cs5501-spring24/assets/datasets/export.csv) 
(using `wget`). 
Download the file to your home directory of `vm1`.

You then need to sort the data firstly by the country code alphabetically
(the third column `ccr2`) then by the timestamp (the last column).
Here is an example:

**Input:**

```
... cca2 ...  device_id ... timestamp
... US   ...  1         ... 1
... IN   ...  2         ... 2
... US   ...  3         ... 2
... CN   ...  4         ... 4
... US   ...  5         ... 3
... IN   ...  6         ... 1
```

**Output:**

```
...	cca2 ...  device_id ... timestamp
...	CN   ...  4         ...	4
...	IN   ...  6         ...	1
...	IN   ...  2         ...	2
...	US   ...  1         ...	1
...	US   ...  3         ...	2
...	US   ...  5         ...	3
```

You should first load the data into HDFS by the following command:

```sh
$ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal export.csv /
```

Then, write a PySpark program in Python to sort the data. Examples 
of self-contained applications in Python are given [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications).

We suggest you also go through the 
[Spark SQL Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-getting-started.html) 
(we focus on Spark DataFrame, which is built atop Spark SQL)
and the [APIs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.3.0/api/python/index.html).
Spark DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into
named columns. It is conceptually equal to a table in a relational
database. In our case you will create DataFrames from the data that
you load into HDFS. Users may also ask Spark to persist a DataFrame
in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently in subsequent actions
(not necessary to do for this part of the assignment, but will need
to do it in part 3).

An example of a couple commands when using `PySpark` (Python API
that supports Spark) that should be handy.
Note that you need to install `PySpark` using `pip3 install pyspark`.
You also need to install `findspark` so that your Jupyter Notebook session
knows where to find your PySpark dependencies.

```python
import findspark
findspark.init('/home/ubuntu/spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3')
findspark.find()
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Add the above code snippet to the very beginning of your Notebook
and always run it first to let Notebook know where it should find
your PySpark environment.


```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# The entry point into all functionality in Spark is the SparkSession class.
spark = (SparkSession
	.builder
	.appName("DS5110/CS5501: my awesome Spark program")
	.master(private_IPv4_addr_of_master:7077)
	.config("spark.executor.memory", "1024M")
	.getOrCreate())

# You can read the data from a file into DataFrames
df = spark.read.csv("/path/to/a/json/file")
```

Where the config option is to set the Spark executor's memory size to 1024 MB.
And the path to target file `/path/to/a/json/file` in our case should
be an HDFS path of the `export.csv` file that you have just copied to
HDFS.  An example HDFS path looks like the following: 
`hdfs://<private_IPv4_addr_of_vm1>:9000/export.csv`.

After loading data you can apply DataFrame operations on it.
The following is just an example. You should use the right DataFrame
APIs to complete Part 2.

```python
df.select("name").show()
df.filter(df['age'] > 21).show()
```

Finally, your application should output the new DF results to HDFS as an
HDFS file in form of `csv`. One way to save DataFrame content to HDFS
is to use `df.write.format("csv")`:

```python
df.write.format("csv").mode("overwrite").save("hdfs://private_IPv4_addr_vm1:9000/output_file_name")
```


> **NOTE:** To view the status of your running application, click on Active Jobs 
and go to the running Jod Id on your Spark Jobs webpage. It will
bring you to the application status page.  From there, you can view
the details including application progress, DAG visualization,
breakdown of the execution statistics, etc.  


## Part 3: PageRank

In this part, you will implement the
[PageRank algorithm](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html) (§2.1)
(or [the Wikipedia version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank#Simplified_algorithm)),
which is an algorithm used by search engines like Google to evaluate
the quality of links to a webpage. The algorithm can be summarized as
follows:

1. Set initial rank of each page to be 1.
2. On each iteration, each page p contributes to its outgoing neighbors a value of rank(p)/(# of outgoing neighbors of p).
3. Update each page's rank to be 0.15 + 0.85 * (sum of contributions).
4. Go to next iteration.

In this assignment, we will run the algorithm on the.
[`Berkeley-Stanford` web graph dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-BerkStan.html).
Each line in the dataset consists of a page and one of its neighbors.
You need to decompress the downloaded `.gz` dataset (using `gunzip`)
and copy the input file to HDFS first. 


```sh
$ wget https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-BerkStan.txt.gz
$ gunzip web-BerkStan.txt.gz
$ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal web-BerkStan.txt.gz /
```

> **IMPORTANT:** Once again, add the following code snippet to the very beginning of your Notebook
and always run it first to let Notebook know where it should find
your PySpark environment (*you may skip this if you have done so for
Part 2*):

```python
import findspark
findspark.init('/home/ubuntu/spark-3.3.1-bin-hadoop3')
findspark.find()
```

**In this part, always run the algorithm for a total of 10
iterations.** However, for debugging purpose, you may use a smaller
iteration number, say 3 or 4 so that you don't need to wait for too
long to see the result. 

This part features three tasks as follows:

* **Task 1.** Write a PySpark application that implements the 
PageRank algorithm. Your PageRank application should output the following
two results: 
1) print the first 50 rows with the highest ranks;
2) save the computed results as a Spark DF to HDFS as an HDFS csv file. 
* **Task 2.** In order to achieve high parallelism, Spark will split
the data into smaller chunks called *partitions*, which are
distributed across different nodes in the cluster. Partitions can be
changed in several ways. For example, any shuffle operation on an
RDD (e.g., `join()`) will result in a change in partitions
(customizable via user’s configuration). In addition, one can also
decide how to partition data when creating/configuring RDDs (**hint:** e.g., you can use
the function [`partitionBy()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.RDD.partitionBy.html)). For this task, add appropriate custom RDD partitioning and see what changes. 
For the computed result: your PageRank application should print the
first 50 rows with the highest ranks.
* **Task 3.** Kill a Worker process and see the changes. You should
trigger the failure to a selected worker VM when the application
reaches anywhere between  *25% to 75%* of its lifetime 
(**hint:** use the `Spark Jobs` web interface to track the detailed
job execution progress):
	1. From a shell, clear the memory cache using `sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"` on `vm2`;
	2. In your shell, kill the Worker process on `vm2`: 
To do so, use `jps` to get the process ID (PID) of the Spark Worker
on `vm2` and then use the command `kill -9 <Worker_PID>` to kill the
Spark Worker process. 
	3. For the computed result: your PageRank application should print the first 50 rows with the highest ranks.




## Deliverables

You should submit a `tar.gz` file to Canvas, which follows the naming
convention of `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A2.tar.gz`. The
submitted file should include:
* an `.ipynb` file containing the code of each task (filename: `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A2.ipynb`), 
* a short report (filename: `LastName_FirstName_ComputingID_A2_report.pdf`), 

For the **`.ipynb` Notebook file**, put the code of each part (Part 2 and
3) and each task (Task 1-3 in
Part 3) into separate Notebook cells and comment them well. *You may
split a big chunk of code of a particular task into multiple Notebook
cells for better readability.*
Code comment should indicate Part number and Task number and include
a brief description of the implementation. Comments are worth some
percentage of your grade for the assignment, the GTAs will be looking
at your code as well as the comments (comments serve as a `README`
for a particular task).  

For the **PDF report**, you should report the application completion
time with respect to Task 1-3 in Part 3. Present or reason about the
differences in performance or your own findings, if any. Take a look
at the DAG lineage graphs of applications, Executor statistics (e.g.,
shuffle read, shuffle write), and the number of tasks for every
execution from the `Spark Jobs` web UI; these information may help
you better understand the performance issues.
